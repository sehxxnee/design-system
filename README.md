# TypeScript + Storybook + Rollup based Design System     
While working on multiple projects, I often found myself rebuilding the same components repeatedly, which was both time-consuming and inefficient.  <br>
To address this issue, I decided to build a scalable design system.
<br><br>
Each component is documented and showcased using Storybook, making it easy to review, test, and reuse.  <br>
The system is bundled with Rollup into a lightweight package and published as an NPM library, allowing seamless integration across different projects.<br>

I plan to keep expanding the system by adding more components and improving its overall architecture over time.
